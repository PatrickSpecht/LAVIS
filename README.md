# LAVIS
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that has been created to predict unloading times of container vessels at seaport terminals.

All code has been produced within the project "LAVIS - Intelligent Data Analysis for Predicting Cargo Availability within Seaports". The project has received funding by the German Ministry for Transportation and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI) within the mFUND programme.
